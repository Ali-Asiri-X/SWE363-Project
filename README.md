## Introduction
 A web-based tool designed to assist KFUPM students in creating
 capstone groups for their senior projects. The website will
 display teams that are looking for members to join. Additionally,
 the website will show suggested combinations based on the team
 members' university majors and the compatible fields for them.
 After reviewing the specifics of the teams they liked, the user will
 be able to submit a request to join them.


## Getting Started
All necessary tools are available in the project without requiring further installation.

After cloning the project, you can use a live server extension, such as https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer, to display the front end in your browser.

## Architecture
All files in this project are organized in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any subdirectories. 

The CSS framework used is Bootstrap.
